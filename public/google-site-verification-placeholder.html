<!--
  This is a placeholder file to help with Search Console URL-prefix verification.
  Google will provide a file like `googleXXXXXXXXXXXX.html` containing a verification token.
  Replace this file's name and contents with the exact file Google gives you, then click Verify in Search Console.

  Example: If Google asks you to upload a file named `google1234567890abcdef.html`,
  save that file into the `public/` directory of this project so it's available at
  https://www.elvisforcongress.com/google1234567890abcdef.html
